<h2>What is Krill Oil?</h2>
<p>Krill oil is extracted from tiny shrimp-like crustaceans called krill, predominantly found in the icy waters of the Antarctic Ocean. These krill are a primary food source for many marine animals, including whales, seals, and penguins. Krill oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for various bodily functions. Unlike fish oil, which contains omega-3s in the form of triglycerides, krill oil contains omega-3s as phospholipids. This unique composition makes krill oil more bioavailable, meaning it is easier for the body to absorb and utilize.</p>
<p>Krill oil also contains astaxanthin, a powerful antioxidant that helps protect the oil from oxidation and offers additional health benefits.</p>

<h3>Health Benefits of NativePath Antarctic Krill Oil</h3>
